If you focus for a minute on the creature, you may attempt to delve into its mind for hidden secrets. When you do so the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you may telepathically ask one question which can be answered with either \"yes\" or \"no\". The creature must answer this question truthfully.
