This arrangement can range between a comfortable position where the dancer occupies a space akin to a spouse, or a much more restricted affair where the dancer is often bound only to be partially released when performing. The nature of this arrangement is dependent on the predilections of both the dancer and the patron, and in truth some of the most lucrative positions reside with those who devote themselves to the latter.",

Others include various torments or feats of endurance as part of their act which can in turn increase their rates and standing. Particularly sadistic nobles will pay huge sums for a dancer who is capable of putting on a show that excites them for such nobles have seen many tortures and are rarely impressed. So too do court dancers come in all shapes and sizes, all genders and orientations. The generally accepting nature of Bundheim has created a world in which all manner of dancers are cherished.",

This in turn aids their performances as few want to watch a dancer who is stumbling their way through their routine. As well, many are fiercely territorial toward their patrons and live in constant fear they will be replaced. In this way dancers are prone to developing a very vindictive attitude that can be harsh to those they perceive as a threat. Yet, thanks to their performative abilities, they are extremely careful to keep an enticing face toward their patron or any who would influence them.",
